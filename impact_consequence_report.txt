🌍 GLOBAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
• Immediate Response Required: International emergency coordination
• Long-term Effects: Climate impact from debris, agricultural disruption
• Recovery Timeline: 5-50 years depending on impact magnitude
• Planetary Defense: Enhanced detection and deflection systems needed

🚨 RISK MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Strengthen NEO detection networks globally
2. Develop rapid response asteroid deflection technology  
3. Create international impact response protocols
4. Establish emergency evacuation procedures for high-risk areas
5. Build resilient infrastructure in populated regions

💡 SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTS:
• Size matters: Even small asteroids can cause significant regional damage
• Location is critical: Impacts near populated areas have exponential consequences  
• Early warning essential: Detection time allows for evacuation and preparation
• Economic impact far exceeds direct physical damage

======================================================================
This analysis demonstrates the critical importance of planetary defense systems
and the need for continued investment in asteroid detection and deflection technology.
