  "projectName": "Impactor-2025",
  "hackathon": "Hackat√≥n GDL - NASA Challenge",
  "challenge": "Meteor Madness",
  "projectSummary": "To design an interactive web platform where any user (scientist, politician, student, or citizen) can simulate an asteroid impact using real data and visualize its consequences. The goal is to merge educational and scientific aspects, explaining complex concepts through understandable infographics, narratives, and simulations without losing scientific accuracy.",
  "problemStatement": "Currently, NASA and the USGS manage their data separately. NASA's NEO API provides data on asteroid size, velocity, and trajectory, while the USGS offers maps and data on seismic zones, elevations, and tsunami-prone regions. This separation complicates the ability to create a clear simulation of an asteroid's impact and its consequences. The project aims to bridge the gap between this complex data and public understanding through interactive visualizations and a user-friendly interface.",
  "keyFeatures": [
    {
      "feature": "Real-Data Simulation",
      "description": "Users can simulate an asteroid's fall using real data (size, speed, angle, trajectory). They can adjust parameters like velocity or entry angle using sliders."
    },
    {
      "feature": "Consequence Visualization",
      "description": "The tool will show the physical and environmental consequences of the impact in real-time, including crater size, affected tsunami zones, and atmospheric or local climate changes."
    },
    {
      "feature": "Mitigation Strategy Testing",
      "description": "Includes a 'Defend the Earth' game mode where users can test different mitigation strategies, such as deflecting the asteroid with a probe."
    }
  ],
  "technicalAspects": {
    "recommendedLanguages": [
      "Python (for data handling)",
      "JavaScript (for browser visualization)"
    ],
    "possibleLibraries": [
      "Three.js (for 3D graphics)",
      "D3.js (for 2D maps and graphs)",
      "Flask or Django (for the backend)"
    ],
    "visualDesign": "A clean interface with easy-to-understand controls like sliders, buttons, and interactive maps.",
    "optimization": "Simulations should be fast and run smoothly without causing the browser to freeze.",
    "accessibility": "Must be understandable for the general public, with language options, explanatory text, and accessible colors."
